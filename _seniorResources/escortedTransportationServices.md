Since 1973, our agency has been advocating for seniors, their families and caregivers. As an Area Agency on Aging (AAoA) member agency, our highly trained staff and dedicated volunteers provide services to adults 60 years old or better who live in Kane, Kendall and McHenry counties. In 2012 our by-laws were amended to allow services to persons age 18 to 59 in response to being asked to administer the Veterans Intervention Program (VIP); this program provides needed services to veterans of all ages. In 2014 services to this age group were expanded to include Information and Assistance, Adult Protective Services and Nursing Home and Community Ombudsman. We are happy to refer those living outside of our service area to an appropriate AAoA nearest them.
